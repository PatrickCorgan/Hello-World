# Hello-World
My first repository

I created this repository to learn about GitHub. I am particularly interested in the collaborative
and version control aspects of GitHub. I have learned that GitHub is so much more than just code
sharing. Being able to branch my project and make changes (or have others make changes) without
affecting the stable main branch is a great help. But even more powerful is the ability to merge
changes back into the main branch when they are stable.
